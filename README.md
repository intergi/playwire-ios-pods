## List of available CLI actions

### Setup environment

- Open up Terminal, `cd` into your top-level project directory
- Install gems

```
$ bundle install
```

### Lint pod

> **Note**: Before proceeding further, please verify that `podspec` and `xcframework`'s are presented and up-to-date in top-level project's `Vendor` directory.

- Open up Terminal, `cd` into your top-level project directory

- Lint podspec before pushing to the remote

```ruby
$ bundle exec fastlane lint_pod
```

### Push pod

> **Note**: Before proceeding further, please verify that xcframework binaries are already uploaded to a remote repository and corresponding commit is tagged with correct version.
> **Note**: Also please ensure that you already downloaded private spec repository to your local machine using command `pod repo add plw-ios-podspec git@github.com:intergi/playwire-ios-podspec.git`. That will download podspec repo into `~/.cocoapods/repos/plw-ios-podspec/` directory. Please set here the same shared git config from the README beginning, so every time you're pushing new pod version it will be correspondingly authored in git.

- Push specified podspec to the remote

```ruby
$ bundle exec fastlane push_pod
```
